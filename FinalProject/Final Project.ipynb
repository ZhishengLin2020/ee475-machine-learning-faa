    "## **1.Topic**\n",
    "Our project focus on using the dataset of 2018-2019 NBA Seasons to predict the results of 2019-2020 NBA Regular Seasons\n",
    "\n",
    "Basketball is one of the most competitive sports around the world. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a men's professional basketball league in North America, which also gathers world’s top basketball athletes. In addition to enjoy the exciting matches, we also want to be able to predict which teams could make playoffs and which team will finally get the championship. As we can get enough data from basketball reference websites, this could be a very practical way to apply machine learning into the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.Design description**\n",
    "1.   **Data Collection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      Collect the NBA seasons data from web:https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2019.html. \n",
    "      The data consists of three datasets. One that is Team Per Game Stats, One that is Opponent Per Game Stats,and one\n",
    "      that is Miscellaneous Stats.Then, we refine the data. The related function and detailed annotation can be found in function: \n",
    "          DataTrim(oppo_data,team_data,mis_data)\n",

    "          Output:\n",
    "            features and labels for training.\n",
    "2.   **Feature Extraction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      Use the elo score rating system to describe the feature.Elo score refer to the formula that can calculate each other's win expectation. There are four steps for getting features.\n",
